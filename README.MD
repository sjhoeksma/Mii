# Mii an Opensource Real Time, Timing solution
This solution can be used to create your own real time timing solution. It can be for example be used for mesuaring
the time needed to run a 10 meter sprint or do ski run.

We provide the hardware components, created with Eagle from CadSoft, emmbedded software written in arduino and a HTML5 app for Web & Mobile devices written with IONIC framework 1.3. For hardware components we provide the 3D models allowing you to print them your self.

## Components
1. MiiChrono and a MiiBeam make a start of finish line
2. MiiScoreboard can be used to show the time
3. MiiApp is the HMTL5 app
4. Mii3D are the 3D models for your printer in using openScad
5. Lib contains all libaries you need
